# T&A Explore
T&amp;A Explore is a Fabric mod loader based modpack for Minecraft 1.19.2 with mainly exploration type content mixed with some automation stuff like Create 0.5.1 and Botany Pots.

The "boss" of this pack is my 10-year-old child, who does quite a bit role-play type stuff on it and who is a much better builder than I am.

Currently, this Github project exists purely so we can have an issue tracker. We may start putting the actual modpack stuff on here soon.

## Our mod usage philosophy
We try to keep to only mods hosted on Modrinth, but currently that isn't entirely possible because some of the mods we feel we can't lose are only available on CurseForge.

In instances where the authors of mods on CurseForse do allow them to be used in non-CurseForge packs, we provide attribution links back to those mods in the main Modrinth page for this pack and here.

In cases (well, one at the moment, and I see there is now a modified version on Modrinth) where a mod can't be used in a Modrinth modpack, we provide links to the CurseForge pages where players can choose to download and install them manually. **Note that these will always be optional client-side mods**
